# PS - Smart Solutions for Rural Water Security
PROBLEM :
In rural regions facing water scarcity and contamination, the implementation of water supply projects, such as the Jal Jeevan Mission, is crucial for providing clean drinking water to households. Engaging Implementation Support Agencies (ISAs) is vital for the successful execution of these projects at the grassroots level. The challenge is to streamline the planning and mobilization phase, ensuring effective communication and collaboration between NGOs, communities, and Gram Panchayats (GPs) for the sustainable management of water supply systems.

REQUIREMENTS :-
1) Develop a system or platform that facilitates efficient communication and collaboration between NGOs, community members, and GP representatives during the planning and mobilization phase of water supply projects.
2) Develop a robust monitoring and evaluation system that enables realtime tracking of project progress, identifies bottlenecks, and ensures accountability at each stage of the Jal Jeevan Mission.
3) Implement information and education campaigns to raise awareness among community members about the importance of water conservation, hygiene practices, and their roles in sustaining the water supply systems.
4) Implement a decision support system that considers local variations and community feedback in the planning phase, ensuring culturally sensitive and context-specific solutions.
5) Develop information resources and communication materials in multiple languages, considering the linguistic diversity of the community, to enhance understanding and participation.
6) Create protocols and tools for emergency response in case of disruptions or contamination incidents, ensuring swift and effective corrective actions to minimize the impact on communities

# SOLUTION
We will be using IOT Sensors for real time water analysis
Detecting water quality and providing real-time analysis reports involve a combination of hardware and software components.

ThingSpeak Public Channel for sensor data: https://thingspeak.com/apps/matlab_visualizations/534649

Hardware Components:-
1. Sensors: Common parameters to measure include pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, and various contaminants. Therefore we can use pH meters, turbidity sensors, dissolved oxygen sensors, and water quality testing strips.
2. Microcontrollers or Single-Board Computers: Arduino to interface with the sensors and collect data. Raspberry Pi can be used for more complex scenarios and data processing.
3. Communication Module:  Wi-Fi to transmit data to the server for real-time analysis.
4. Power Supply: Batteries can be used for power supply.

Software Components:
1. Arduino IDE : For determining how the sensors' data should be used. And to transmit data in suitable form. 
2. Server-Side Application: ThingSpeak will be used for getting real time analysis and data feed on graph.
