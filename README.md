# PS - Smart Solutions for Rural Water Security
PROBLEM :
In rural regions facing water scarcity and contamination, the implementation of water supply projects, such as the Jal Jeevan Mission, is crucial for providing clean drinking water to households. Engaging Implementation Support Agencies (ISAs) is vital for the successful execution of these projects at the grassroots level. The challenge is to streamline the planning and mobilization phase, ensuring effective communication and collaboration between NGOs, communities, and Gram Panchayats (GPs) for the sustainable management of water supply systems.

REQUIREMENTS :-
1) Develop a system or platform that facilitates efficient communication and collaboration between NGOs, community members, and GP representatives during the planning and mobilization phase of water supply projects.
2) Develop a robust monitoring and evaluation system that enables realtime tracking of project progress, identifies bottlenecks, and ensures accountability at each stage of the Jal Jeevan Mission.
3) Implement information and education campaigns to raise awareness among community members about the importance of water conservation, hygiene practices, and their roles in sustaining the water supply systems.
4) Implement a decision support system that considers local variations and community feedback in the planning phase, ensuring culturally sensitive and context-specific solutions.
5) Develop information resources and communication materials in multiple languages, considering the linguistic diversity of the community, to enhance understanding and participation.
6) Create protocols and tools for emergency response in case of disruptions or contamination incidents, ensuring swift and effective corrective actions to minimize the impact on communities
